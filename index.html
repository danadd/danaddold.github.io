    On my homepage I just want a quick blurb: Hi, I'm Dana, I do this, My goals are this: check out my work below!
    I want an about page too, just brief about who I am, where I'm from, my hobbies, and then my skills. But I want the skills to display as Zelda hearts. Full 5 hearts = best. Low hearts = not so great. I want to bring out that gamer side of me and talk about coding I do for that~ I think it would be a nice point to talk about! I should talk about how I love coding Skyrim/Stardew/etc.
    So:
        >Welcome Page
        >Scroll down to see my projects
        >Maybe use java to make the page "roll" over to my about page. I kinda want the hearts to be animated? But that may be too much for me... 
        Then the whole time I need a navigation pane to help people get back to other parts of my website. It's gonna be a really quick and brief website, but I still need people to be able to find me and navigate through things!
        And then that's it! Host my website and host Baek's, my timer website, and my clock website~ And that's all!
        I also want to maybe have my navigation on the side pane? Like right side? That would make it unique and different!
        So the navi is on the right and scrolls with the website. Then when people click on a link it animates them to the new page.
    -->
    <!--Alright I want an animated side nav too! Might take me some time to do it but I think it will be a nice touch???-->
    <!--COntact page is the only page with working animations lmao. So study that and figure out how to get it to work-->
